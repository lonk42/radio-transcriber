# Radio Transcriber
This is a three part stack for recording SDR based radio to file, processing those files by generating transcriptions and making them browsable via a webGUI.


## TODO
* Post-process the files to eliminate small ones or blips, this is done already in the application by skipping anything with no transcription but still means they exist when they shouldn't
